Welcome to bootc's wiki!
========================

This is a wiki of sorts where I have documented various things that I've worked
on or figured out. Hopefully you'll find useful things here.

Contributions are welcome, but this "wiki" doesn't have a pretty editor.
Instead it uses `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to build the pages from
a `Git repository <https://github.com/bootc/wiki>`_ hosted on GitHub.
